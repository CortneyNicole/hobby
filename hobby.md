# Ice Skating
**Ice skating is an elegant dance like sport that requires a lot of talent and dedication.** I use to compete but then injured my knee so now I just do it for fun. 
## Why I Still Like to Skate:
* good work out
* feels like I'm flying
* I like to teach friends to skate

    def ice_skating
      var fall = true
        if fall 
          puts "Ouch!"
        else 
          puts "You Did It!!"
        end
    end
